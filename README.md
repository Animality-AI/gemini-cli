## 🎯 What is Gemini CLI?

The Gemini CLI is your **intelligent development assistant** that bridges the gap between natural language and code execution. Think of it as having a senior developer who understands your entire codebase, can read your mind, and executes complex tasks with surgical precision.

### ✨ What You Can Do

🔍 **Code Intelligence**
- Query and refactor massive codebases beyond Gemini's 1M token context window
- Get architectural insights and security analysis instantly
- Navigate complex systems with natural language queries

🎨 **Creative Generation**  
- Transform PDFs, sketches, or ideas into full applications using multimodal AI
- Generate everything from Discord bots to enterprise dashboards
- Convert mockups to production-ready code

⚡ **Workflow Automation**
- Automate complex git operations, PR reviews, and deployments  
- Connect with [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for unlimited tool integration
- Build custom workflows that understand your development patterns

🌐 **Enhanced Capabilities**
- [Media generation with Imagen, Veo & Lyria](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-creative-studio/tree/main/experiments/mcp-genmedia)
- Built-in [Google Search grounding](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding) for real-time information
- Seamless integration with your existing development tools

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **Prerequisites**: Node.js ≥18.0.0 ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/download))

### Option 1: Instant Run (Recommended)
```bash
npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
```

### Option 2: Global Install
```bash
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
gemini
```

### 🎨 First Launch Setup
1. **Choose your theme** - Pick from beautiful color schemes
2. **Authenticate** - Sign in with your Google account
   - ✅ **Free tier**: 60 requests/minute, 1,000 requests/day
   - 🚀 **No setup required** - Just your Google account!

**That's it!** You're ready to start building with AI.

### 🔑 Advanced Authentication

Need higher limits or specific models? Use an API key:

1. **Generate key**: Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. **Set environment variable**:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   ```
3. **Enterprise setup**: See [authentication guide](./docs/cli/authentication.md) for Google Workspace accounts

## 📚 Examples

> 💡 **Pro tip**: The magic happens when you combine natural language with your development context!

### 🆕 Starting Fresh
